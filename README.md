# Final Project
by Eric Lanini, Rachel Trail, and Tayla Rund

**NOTE: there is a large issue with the smoke simulation. For an unknown reason, the smoke has only been able to appear on two computers - a MacBook Pro 15 inch 2016 on 10.12.6, and a MacBook Pro Retina 15 inch mid 2014 on 10.11.6. On every other computer tested, it has not displayed.**

That said, the video does show the effect, the code is there, and I (Eric) don't know what else to do. 

This project includes:
- Crepuscular Rays by Tayla Rund
- Smoke Simulation by Eric Lanini and Rachel Trail
- Terrain by Eric
- Fire by Rachel Trail

You can move throught the scene using classic orbit controls and move the camera using the arrow keys.
The GUI controls fire variables and shows or hides the terrain shading.

The project can be run by cloning this repository, and opening FinalProject.html. You can also use the link below.
