# Final Project
by Eric Lanini, Rachel Trail, and Tayla Rund

**NOTE: there is a large issue with the smoke simulation. For an unknown reason, the smoke has only been able to appear on two computers - a MacBook Pro 15 inch 2016 on 10.12.6, and a MacBook Pro Retina 15 inch mid 2014 on 10.11.6. On every other computer tested, it has not displayed.**

That said, the video does show the effect, the code is there, and I (Eric) don't know what else to do. 

This project includes:
- Crepuscular Rays by Tayla Rund
- Smoke Simulation by Eric Lanini and Rachel Trail
